    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
    <p>My name is Hayden McGuire, I am a rising 2L law student at Suffolk Univserity Law School, who is dedicated to working on creating a more equitable legal system. I want to learn to use technology to further this goal.</p>

    <p>I am currently working with the Trial Court Service Center's in Massachusetts using a virtual intake system to expedite access to legal information and assistance to self represented litigants. In tandem, I am working with the Legal Inovation and Technologies Lab at Suffolk University to create tools for that same SRL population.</p>

    <p>
    My path to Law School was unconventional. Initially apprehensive to formal education, and set on a the path to work in a trade, I did not see the legal field in my futre. After seeing my coworkers in the trades have their bodies start to fail, and the daily pain i felt at only 20 years old, I decided that I needed to change paths. 
    I intially went to Community College to study computer networking, the two networking classes I took where the begining and end of my short exposure to computer science in the classroom environment.
    During my time at MassBay Community College I worked as a tutor; this is when my interest in the legal field started to crystalize. After getting an Assocaites Degree I attended Suffolk University's undergaduate school to get study, and get a degree in, Politics Philosophy and Economics.
