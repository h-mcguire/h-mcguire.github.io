    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
    <p>My name is Hayden McGuire, I am a rising 2L law student at Suffolk Univserity Law School, who is dedicated to working on creating a more equitable legal system. I want to learn to use technology to further this goal.</p>

    <p>I am currently working with the Trial Court Service Center's in Massachusetts using a virtual intake system to expedite access to legal information and assistance to self represented litigants. In tandem, I am working with the Legal Inovation and Technologies Lab at Suffolk University to create tools for that same SRL population.</p>

    <p>My path to Law School was unconventional. I went to Community College at MassBay after initially wanting to pursue a carrer in carpentry. During my time at MassBay I worked as a tutor; this is also when my interest in the legal field started to crystalize. After getting an Assocaites Degree I attended Suffolk University's undergaduate school to get study, and get a degree in, Politics Philosophy and Economics.</p>
