    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
    <p>My name is Hayden McGuire, I am a rising 2L law student at Suffolk Law, who is dedicated to working on creating a more equitable legal
        system. I want to learn to use technology to further this goal.</p>

    <p>I currently am working with the Trial Court Service Center's in Massachusetts using a virtual intake system to
        expidite access to legal information and assistance to self represented litigants. In tandem, I am working with
        the Legal Inovation and Technologies Lab at Suffolk University to create tools for that same SRL population.
